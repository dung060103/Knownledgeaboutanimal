                                The brown bear is a large bear species found across Eurasia and North America
                            </h2>
                            In North America, the populations of brown bears are called grizzly bears, while the
                            subspecies that inhabits the Kodiak Islands of Alaska is known as the Kodiak bear.
                            It is one of the largest living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in
                            size only by its closest relative, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less
                            variable in size and slightly bigger on average.
                            The brown bear's range includes parts of Russia, Central Asia, the Himalayas, China,
                            Canada, the United States, Hokkaido, Scandinavia, Finland, the Balkans, the Picos de
                            Europa and the Carpathian region (especially Romania), Iran, Anatolia, and the Caucasus.
                            The brown bear is recognized as a national and state animal in several European
                            countries.
                            <br> While the brown bear's range has shrunk, and it has faced local extinctions across
                            its wide range, it remains listed as a least concern species by the International Union
                            for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with a total estimated population in 2017 of 110,000.
                            As of 2012, this and the American black bear are the only bear species not classified as
                            threatened by the IUCN, though the large sizes of both bears may be a disadvantage due
                            to increased competition with humans. Populations that were hunted to extinction in the
                            19th and 20th centuries are the Atlas bear of North Africa and the Californian, Ungavan
                            and Mexican populations of the grizzly bear of North America. Many of the populations in
                            the southern parts of Eurasia are highly endangered as well. One of the smaller-bodied
                            forms, the Himalayan brown bear, is critically endangered, occupying only 2% of its
                            former range and threatened by uncontrolled poaching for its body parts. The Marsican
                            brown bear of central Italy is one of several currently isolated populations of the
                            Eurasian brown bear and is believed to have a population of just 50 to 60 bears.
